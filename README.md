### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I am Xiaohuo Ren, currently working for Zilliqa which is a Singapore based blockchain company. There are many public information about the industry and company, but I want to stress our own smart contract language [Scilla](https://scilla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Recently we use it successfully deployed staking project, check our ZIP11(Zilliqa Improvement Proposals) [here](https://github.com/Zilliqa/ZIP/blob/master/zips/zip-11.md) and its implemetation [here](https://github.com/Zilliqa/staking-contract/tree/main/contracts). It's an amazing project!

Besides my major job, what interests me recently is compliers technology. My dream for 2021 is to write a parser using a modern language (e.g. golang or typescript) for scilla. If that also makes you excited, feel free to join me! 

And always, learning new language such as Rust and new tech stack of the fast growing ecosystem. All these will bring us to the future. Never stop!
