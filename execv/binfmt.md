## How Binary Get Loaded

/include/linux/binfmts.h

```c
/*
 * This structure is used to hold the arguments that are used when loading binaries.
 */
struct linux_binprm {
	char buf[BINPRM_BUF_SIZE];
#ifdef CONFIG_MMU
	struct vm_area_struct *vma;
	unsigned long vma_pages;
#else
# define MAX_ARG_PAGES	32
	struct page *page[MAX_ARG_PAGES];
#endif
	struct mm_struct *mm;
	unsigned long p; /* current top of mem */
	unsigned int
		cred_prepared:1,/* true if creds already prepared (multiple
				 * preps happen for interpreters) */
		cap_effective:1;/* true if has elevated effective capabilities,
				 * false if not; except for init which inherits
				 * its parent's caps anyway */
#ifdef __alpha__
	unsigned int taso:1;
#endif
	unsigned int recursion_depth; /* only for search_binary_handler() */
	struct file * file;
	struct cred *cred;	/* new credentials */
	int unsafe;		/* how unsafe this exec is (mask of LSM_UNSAFE_*) */
	unsigned int per_clear;	/* bits to clear in current->personality */
	int argc, envc;
	const char * filename;	/* Name of binary as seen by procps */
	const char * interp;	/* Name of the binary really executed. Most
				   of the time same as filename, but could be
				   different for binfmt_{misc,script} */
	unsigned interp_flags;
	unsigned interp_data;
	unsigned long loader, exec;
};
